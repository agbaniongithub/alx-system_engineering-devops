Issue Summary:
Outage Duration: August 10, 2023, 15:30 - August 10, 2023, 16:45 (UTC)

Impact: Web Application Service (70% of users affected)

Root Cause: Overloaded Database Connections and Slow Queries

Timeline:
	•	15:30: Outage detected as monitoring alerts triggered due to high response times.
	•	15:35: Incident escalated to DevOps team as multiple engineers noticed slow application performance.
	•	15:40: Initial investigation focused on web server logs and load balancer metrics.
	•	15:50: Database connectivity and query performance examined; assumption was on slow database queries.
	•	16:00: Temporary fix attempted by restarting database server, but no significant improvement.
	•	16:15: Realized database connections were at maximum capacity; explored scaling options.
	•	16:30: Incident escalated to Database Administrators for urgent assistance.
	•	16:45: Issue resolved by optimizing database queries and increasing connection limits.


Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the outage was an unexpected surge in user traffic causing the database connections to reach their maximum limit. Slow-running queries added to the problem. This combination led to significant degradation of the web application's performance. The resolution involved:
		Query Optimization: Database Administrators identified and optimized resource-intensive queries, reducing query execution times by up to 80%.
		Connection Management: The connection pool was reconfigured to handle higher connection limits during peak loads, preventing overloads.


Corrective and Preventative Measures:
		Database Scaling: Evaluate the need for horizontal database scaling to distribute the load during traffic spikes.
		Caching Strategy: Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data to reduce the reliance on the database.
		Monitoring Enhancements: Set up more granular monitoring alerts for database connection limits and query execution times.
		Load Testing: Regularly conduct load testing to simulate heavy traffic scenarios and identify potential bottlenecks.
		Auto-scaling: Implement auto-scaling mechanisms for the web application and database resources based on predefined thresholds.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
		Implement Query Monitoring: Set up database query monitoring tools to identify slow queries in real-time.
		Automate Scaling: Develop scripts to automate the scaling of resources based on traffic patterns.
		Database Indexing: Review and improve indexing strategies to optimize query performance.
		Documentation Update: Document the incident, root cause analysis, and resolution steps for future reference.
		Response Plan: Define a clear response plan for similar incidents, outlining roles and responsibilities.


In conclusion, the recent outage was caused by a surge in user traffic that overwhelmed the database connections, leading to slow query performance. The swift response of the teams involved in diagnosing and resolving the issue prevented extended downtime. Moving forward, the company will focus on enhancing monitoring, scaling strategies, and proactive load testing to ensure the system's resilience during peak usage periods. This incident serves as a valuable learning opportunity to fortify the application's infrastructure and response capabilities.
